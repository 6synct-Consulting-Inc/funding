# funding

An analysis of the NRC - IRAP funding that has been granted to corporations.
Dataframe created with pandas, infographics displayed with Dash Enterprise, from Plotly.

This app aims to answer questions such as:
1. How many companies have received federal funding (how many are new in 2019_20)?
2. What is the total annual federal budget for IRAP funding?
3. What is the National/Local budget for funding? What are the trends from year to year?
4. How is the funding distributed? (Is it based on populations? Industry type? other factors?)
5. How novel is my grant request compared to already funded projects?
6. Which federal program should I apply to?
7. How much funding should I apply for (compared to other similarly sized companies, research opportunities, jurisdictional budget limits)?
